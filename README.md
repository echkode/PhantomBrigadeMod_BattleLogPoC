# BattleLog (PoC)

A proof-of-concept library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that puts in place some basic infrastructure for showing a log window.

It is compatible with game patch **1.0.4**. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

This mod currently does nothing except add a hotkey to toggle showing/hiding a blank, white full-screen window. This is just the plumbing to get basic user interaction and a display surface for showing the log.
